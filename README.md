## Usage

### Getting started

This project is not a replacement for big companies like Medium. It is not a blog, but just a simple note-taking app which is primarily developed to summarise YouTube videos, taking notes on some topics and sharing them later on.

Since the project is based on Next.js arcitecture, even though it has dynamic data fetching from database, it is still blazingly fast. I developed it as semi progressive web app, which means you can use it on your phone like an actual program if you have internet connection.

> For the curious ones, the website itself has a 100 score on every category in Lighthouse tests.

### Creating an account

If you have a Github account (which I believe you do), you already have a ResearchBox account. Simply press `Login` button anywhere on screen to start using ResearchBox.
